## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces. Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

This includes:
- **GitHub Repository**: Issues, pull requests, discussions, and code comments
- **Community Forums**: EGAMMO Board discussions related to the project
- **Social Media**: When representing the project or EGAMMO.gaming
- **Events**: Conferences, meetups, or presentations about the project
- **Direct Communication**: Emails or messages sent on behalf of the project

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement:

### Reporting Options
- **GitHub Issues**: For code-related conduct issues (public)
- **Email**: Contact EGAMMO.gaming directly (private)
- **Community Forum**: [EGAMMO Board](https://board.egammo.eu/) moderators
- **Direct Message**: Contact project maintainers privately

### Information to Include
When reporting conduct issues, please include:
- Description of the incident
- Date and time (if applicable)
- Screenshots or links to problematic content
- Any relevant context
- Impact of the behavior on you or the community

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

### 1. Correction
**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

**Consequence**: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

### 2. Warning
**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series of actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.

### 3. Temporary Ban
**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period. Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

### 4. Permanent Ban
**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.

**Consequence**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the community.

## Appeals Process

If you believe you have been unfairly accused of violating this Code of Conduct, you may appeal the decision by:

1. **Contacting project maintainers** within 30 days of the enforcement action
2. **Providing additional context** or information not previously considered
3. **Demonstrating changed behavior** if applicable
4. **Requesting a review** by different community leaders

Appeals will be reviewed by community leaders not involved in the original enforcement decision.
