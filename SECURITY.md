- **Deprecated (1.0.x)**: No security updates - upgrade recommended

## Security Considerations

### Static Analysis Tool Security

As a static analysis tool, the Enhanced C/C++ Dependency Analyzer processes source code files. While it does not execute analyzed code, several security considerations apply:

#### üîç **Code Analysis Security**
- **File System Access**: The analyzer reads files from specified directories
- **Path Traversal**: Processes include statements and PRAGMA_PATH definitions  
- **Memory Safety**: Handles potentially malformed source files
- **Resource Consumption**: Manages memory and processing time for large codebases

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Potential Security Risks**
1. **Malicious Source Files**: Crafted source files could potentially cause:
   - Buffer overflows in pattern matching
   - Infinite loops in circular include detection
   - Excessive memory consumption
   - Path traversal attacks via include statements

2. **Include Resolution**: Processing PRAGMA_PATH and includes could:
   - Access files outside intended directories
   - Follow symbolic links to sensitive areas
   - Process files with excessive nesting depth

3. **Report Generation**: Output files could:
   - Overwrite existing files if permissions allow
   - Expose sensitive path information
   - Create files in unintended locations

## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. Please help us maintain the security of the project by reporting issues responsibly.

### üö® **How to Report**

### **Example Report Template**
```
Subject: [SECURITY] Buffer Overflow in Include Path Processing

Description:
A buffer overflow occurs when processing include statements with paths longer than MAX_PATH_LEN.

Impact:
- Potential code execution via crafted source files
- Denial of service through application crash
- Information disclosure via memory corruption

Affected Versions:
- 1.3.0 and earlier
- Confirmed on Windows 10 with Visual Studio 2022

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create source file with include statement containing 600+ character path
2. Run: analyzer.exe .\test malicious.c output.txt
3. Observe crash in include_resolution() function

Suggested Fix:
Add bounds checking in find_include_file_enhanced() function
```
